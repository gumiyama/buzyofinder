# Database
# mansion.db contains scraped data. 
# Uncomment the next line if you DO NOT want to upload data to GitHub
# *.db
# For now, I'm keeping the DB if it's small, but usually we ignore it.
# Given it's a personal scraping tool, user might want the data. 
# But standard practice is to ignore sqlite. 
# I will decide to IGNORE the db to avoid conflicts and size issues.
